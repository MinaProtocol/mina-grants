![Coda Grants](https://github.com/CodaProtocol/coda-grants/blob/master/static/img/coda-grants-header.jpg)

The grant program is designed to encourage community members to work on projects related to developing the Coda protocol and community. About $2.1M USD in token grants has been allocated to support these efforts prior to Coda’s mainnet launch. There will be additional token grants allocated after mainnet.

## How to Apply

Fill out <a href ="https://forms.gle/ekPwDKE1BArTqVCu9">this form</a> to apply for an open project. Applicants who are selected will have the opportunity to claim or “lock” the project so that they can work on it exclusively.

We will review all applications and evaluate them on the following criteria:
<ul>
  <li>Previous experience in the domain of the project</li>
<li>Previous open-source contributions is a plus, but not necessary</li>
<li>Prior involvement in the Coda community is a plus, but not necessary</li>
<li>Interest in Coda and cryptocurrencies is a plus, but not necessary</li>
</ul>

**Completed and current grant projects**
Block Explorer
- Contributor: bitfly
- Link: http://coda.bitfly.at/
- Description: An open source Coda block explorer that provides aggregated data about the Coda network and enables the users to view transactions, blocks, and accounts.  
- Repo: https://github.com/gobitfly/coda-explorer

Staking Explorer
- Contributor: Figment Network 
- Type: Open source
- Figment’s Hubble provides a block producers viewer, transactions viewer, account viewer, alerts for block producers and Snarketplace dashboard for the Coda protocol blockchain.    

Coda Gateway 
- Contributor: Figment Network 
- Type: Open source
- Provide a set of API’s that enable Gateway access for signing transactions, Transaction Search, Staking, and much more without running your own node. 

Block Producer Performance Dashboard 
- Contributor: dsrv labs
- Type: Open source
- A performance dashboard that enables block producers to view the metrics that help them have a good understanding of their node’s performance and identify ways to optimize the operation. The dashboard will present information such as memory & CPU, slots won, blocks produced as % fo slots won, uptime %, block gossip latencies by node, and many other metrics.   

Snarker Performance Dashboard
- Contributor: dsrv labs
- Type: Open source
- A performance dashboard that enables snarkers to view the metrics that help them have a good understanding of their snarking operations, and identify ways to optimize the operation. The dashboard will present information such as memory & CPU, # of snarks added, # of sold snarks as % of added snarks that were sold, uptime %, snarker fees, and many other metrics.

Tokenomics Simulator
- Contributor: Gauntlet Network
- A robust statistical model of Coda protocol economics, which will consist of a Python representation of key protocol logic, running on Gauntlet’s simulation cluster as well as agent and market models. These will allow Gauntlet and Coda to provide informed recommendations on choices for key protocol parameters as well as map out failure and success conditions for the protocol achieving efficient consensus. 

Making Code Compilation Easier - Bazel 
- Contributor: Gregg Reynolds
- Link: https://github.com/mobileink/coda#schedule 
- Making compilation of code easier for the Coda protocol engineers. 


## FAQ

#### Where do I begin if I want to understand how Coda works?
Visit [the Coda docs](https://codaprotocol.com/docs).
#### Can teams apply?
Yes, we can fund both individuals and teams.
#### Does it matter where I live / work from
Not one bit - as long as you can be contacted within your work timezone, geographic location is not a consideration.
#### How do I increase the chance of getting selected for a grant?
See the <a href="https://forms.gle/ekPwDKE1BArTqVCu9">Application Process</a> section for selection criteria. Please also reach out to us if you have any unique skills that don’t apply to any current projects.
Alternatively, just show up and start <a href="https://github.com/CodaProtocol/coda">contributing code to Coda</a> -- grants will give precedence to previous contributors.
#### What is expected of me, if I receive a grant?
We expect grant recipients to:

- Communicate effectively and create a tight feedback loop so we can iron out any issues as they arise
- Meet any milestones listed in the project
- Serve as ambassadors of Coda in the larger crypto community
#### Where do I go if I need help?
Join the Coda Discord channel or reach out to grants[at]o1labs[dot]org to get help.

## About Coda

Coda is a cryptocurrency protocol that leverages zk-SNARKs to effectively compress the blockchain. Participants in the protocol can generate proofs that historical blockchain states were valid, and use the SNARK proof as a replacement for storing all the blockchain data. This effectively reduces the size of the blockchain to that of a couple tweets.

O(1) Labs is currently developing Coda as a completely open-source protocol, and serves as the current steward of the project. As such, community support and ownership of the protocol is not only encouraged but desired. The Coda Grants program is just the first of many initiatives to democratize the development and growth of Coda.

For any questions regarding the program, email grants[at]o1labs[dot]org.
